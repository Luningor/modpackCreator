Base ingredient == not craftable
	Not CRAFTABLE, not necesarily non-renewable. Tree saplings (vanilla) are loot table drops, yet they aren't craftable, for example.
	This is to avoid circular drop/craft logic. Take ores and raw metals.
	If you can renew ores, then the raw metals are not base ingredients, logically, since they can be 'crafted'. 
	But if the renewal needs gold to make an ore, then the ore is also not a base ingredient, and none of the materials get EMC'd.
	Maybe remove the base ingredient status if it's a loot_tables/block/ drop (with the same name as it's ID) and the drop isn't the same block.
	Logic being, a craftable block being broken, dropping this is clearly a way to 'craft' the item. 
	The same block being dropped (even with silk touch) by itself it's not an instance of this.
TO DO: 
	- Check circular, all non-base ingredient recipe loops for potential base ingredients.
		Probably tiebreak via loot table drop. (ironic)
	- Check for equivalents for potential base ingredients
	- Make recipe node map for crafting tree visualization and debugging
	- Make duplicate recipes checker
	- Make recipeData file and file initialization (to save the recipemap)
	- Add loot table mob delegation for mobData
	- Get a way to get mobs default stats?
	- Make potionEffectData (effect|desc)
